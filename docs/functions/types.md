# Types of Functions

[TOC]

Waffles is built around Bash functions. Some are only used internally, but others are available for use in your roles and profiles.

## stdlib

Functions that are prefixed with `stdlib` are considered core to Waffles. They can be used anywhere.

## non-stdlib

Functions that are not prefixed with `stdlib` should be considered optional. Anything not prefixed with `stdlib` should _not_ be used in an `stdlib` function.
