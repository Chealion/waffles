## 0.1.0 - June 9, 2015

Waffles initial release.

Waffles is a simple configuration management and deployment system written in Bash. I started this project both to see if such a tool was possible as well as to create a more simple deployment system for my own experiments.

The initial release of Waffles contains a variety of resources and documentation. It's able to configure local nodes as well as remote nodes via `rsync`.
